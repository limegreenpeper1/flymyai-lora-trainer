## 📁 Data Preparation

### Dataset Structure for Training

The training data should follow the same format for both Qwen and FLUX models, where each image has a corresponding text file with the same name:

```
dataset/
├── img1.png
├── img1.txt
├── img2.jpg
├── img2.txt
├── img3.png
├── img3.txt
└── ...
```

### Dataset Structure for Qwen-Image-Edit Training

For control-based image editing, the dataset should be organized with separate directories for target images/captions and control images:

```
dataset/
├── images/           # Target images and their captions
│   ├── image_001.jpg
│   ├── image_001.txt
│   ├── image_002.jpg
│   ├── image_002.txt
│   └── ...
└── control/          # Control images
    ├── image_001.jpg
    ├── image_002.jpg
    └── ...
```
### Data Format Requirements

1. **Images**: Support common formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
2. **Text files**: Plain text files containing image descriptions
3. **File naming**: Each image must have a corresponding text file with the same base name

### Example Data Structure

```
my_training_data/
├── portrait_001.png
├── portrait_001.txt
├── landscape_042.jpg
├── landscape_042.txt
├── abstract_design.png
├── abstract_design.txt
└── style_reference.jpg
└── style_reference.txt
```

### Text File Content Examples

**For FLUX character training (portrait_001.txt):**
```
ohwx woman, professional headshot, studio lighting, elegant pose, looking at camera
```

**For Qwen landscape training (landscape_042.txt):**
```
Mountain landscape at sunset, dramatic clouds, golden hour lighting, wide angle view
```

**For FLUX portrait training (abstract_design.txt):**
```
ohwx woman, modern portrait style, soft lighting, artistic composition
```

### Data Preparation Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images (recommended 1024x1024 or higher)
2. **Description Quality**: Write detailed, accurate descriptions of your images
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and quality across your dataset
4. **Dataset Size**: For good results, use at least 10-50 image-text pairs
5. **Trigger Words**: 
   - For FLUX character training: Use "ohwx woman" or "ohwx man" as trigger words
   - For Qwen training: No specific trigger words required
6. **Auto-generate descriptions**: You can generate image descriptions automatically using [Florence-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gokaygokay/Florence-2)

### Quick Data Validation

You can verify your data structure using the included validation utility:

```bash
python utils/validate_dataset.py --path path/to/your/dataset
```

This will check that:
- Each image has a corresponding text file
- All files follow the correct naming convention
- Report any missing files or inconsistencies

## 🏁 Start Training on < 24gb vram

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora_4090.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_4090.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora_4090.yaml
```
![Sample Output](./assets/Valentin_24gb.jpg)


## 🏁 Training

# Qwen Models Training

## Qwen-Image LoRA Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora.yaml
```

Make sure `train_lora.yaml` is correctly set up with paths to your dataset, model, output directory, and other parameters.


### Qwen-Image Full Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_full_qwen_image.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_full_qwen_image.py --config ./train_configs/train_full_qwen_image.yaml
```

Make sure `train_full_qwen_image.yaml` is correctly set up with paths to your dataset, model, output directory, and other parameters.
The proposed method was tested on an NVIDIA H200 GPU environment.
#### Loading Trained Full Model

After training, you can load your trained model from the checkpoint directory for inference.

**Simple Example:**

```python
from diffusers import QwenImagePipeline, QwenImageTransformer2DModel, AutoencoderKLQwenImage
import torch
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
import os

def load_trained_model(checkpoint_path):
    """Load trained model from checkpoint"""
    print(f"Loading trained model from: {checkpoint_path}")
    
    # Load config to get original model path
    config_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_path, "config.yaml")
    config = OmegaConf.load(config_path)
    original_model_path = config.pretrained_model_name_or_path
    
    # Load trained transformer
    transformer_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_path, "transformer")
    transformer = QwenImageTransformer2DModel.from_pretrained(
        transformer_path,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        low_cpu_mem_usage=True
    )
    transformer.to("cuda")
    transformer.eval()
    
    # Load VAE from original model
    vae = AutoencoderKLQwenImage.from_pretrained(
        original_model_path,
        subfolder="vae",
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
    )
    vae.to("cuda")
    vae.eval()
    
    # Create pipeline
    pipe = QwenImagePipeline.from_pretrained(
        original_model_path,
        transformer=transformer,
        vae=vae,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
    )
    pipe.to("cuda")
    
    print("Model loaded successfully!")
    return pipe

# Usage
checkpoint_path = "/path/to/your/checkpoint"
pipe = load_trained_model(checkpoint_path)

# Generate image
prompt = "A beautiful landscape with mountains and lake"
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    width=768,
    height=768,
    num_inference_steps=30,
    true_cfg_scale=5,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
)

# Save result
output_image = image.images[0]
output_image.save("generated_image.png")
```

**Complete Example Script:**

```bash
python inference_trained_model_gpu_optimized.py
```

**Checkpoint Structure:**

The trained model is saved in the following structure:
```
checkpoint/
├── config.yaml          # Training configuration
└── transformer/         # Trained transformer weights
    ├── config.json
    ├── diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.index.json
    └── diffusion_pytorch_model-00001-of-00005.safetensors
    └── ... (multiple shard files)
```


### Qwen-Image-Edit LoRA Training

For control-based image editing training, use the specialized training script:

```bash
accelerate launch train_qwen_edit_lora.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora_qwen_edit.yaml
```

#### Configuration for Qwen-Image-Edit

The configuration file `train_lora_qwen_edit.yaml` should include:

- `img_dir`: Path to target images and captions directory (e.g., `./extracted_dataset/train/images`)
- `control_dir`: Path to control images directory (e.g., `./extracted_dataset/train/control`)
- Other standard LoRA training parameters

## 🧪 Usage

### Qwen-Image-Edit Full Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_full_qwen_edit.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_full_qwen_edit.py --config ./train_configs/train_full_qwen_edit.yaml
```
